# Indian Stock Market Predictor (NSE)

Live App: https://indian-stock-predictor.streamlit.app/

## Project Description
The Indian Stock Market Predictor is a machine learning–based web application developed using Python and Streamlit. It predicts the next NSE trading day price movement (UP or DOWN) and provides an estimated next-day price for selected Indian stocks. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning and feature engineering on real-world financial data for educational purposes.

## Why XGBoost
XGBoost is used because it performs well on structured financial data, handles non-linear relationships efficiently, and provides reliable classification performance with probabilistic confidence scores. These properties make it suitable for short-term directional stock movement prediction.
